### Assignment 3:
- [Q1](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A3/fully_connected_networks.ipynb): Fully-Connected Neural Network. Walk you through implementing Fully-Connected Neural Networks
- [Q2](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A3/convolutional_networks.ipynb): Convolutional Neural Network. Walk you through implementing Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Assignment 4:
- [Q1](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A4/pytorch_autograd_and_nn.ipynb): PyTorch Autograd. Introduce you to the different levels of abstraction that PyTorch provides for building neural network models. You will use this knowledge to implement and train Residual Networks for image classification.

Walk you through the implementation of vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs. You will use these networks to train an image captioning model. You will then augment your implementation to perform spatial attention over image regions while generating captions.
- [Q3](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A4/network_visualization.ipynb): Network Visualization. Walk you through the use of image gradients for generating saliency maps, adversarial examples, and class visualizations

### Assignment 5:
- [Q1](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A5/single_stage_detector_yolo.ipynb): Single-Stage Detector. Walk you through the implementation of a fully-convolutional single-stage object detector similar to YOLO (Redmon et al, CVPR 2016). You will train and evaluate your detector on the PASCAL VOC 2007 object detection dataset.
- [Q2](https://github.com/leopqrz/EECS498-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision/blob/main/A5/two_stage_detector_faster_rcnn.ipynb): Two-Stage Detector. Walk you through the implementation of a two-stage object detector similar to Faster R-CNN (Ren et al, NeurIPS 2015). This will combine a fully-convolutional Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a second-stage recognition network.
